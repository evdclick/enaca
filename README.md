Use of raspberry to integrate and manage energy, water consumption and some other complements as possible.

Oficially started in 2017 as an idea to manage water and energy consumption from people who have my home rented. After that I've been believing that it is possible to integrate this application for other similar stuffs.

In 2018 I tried to create an extended module just for the electronic and some breakers and AC contactors. Still having issues with I2C communications.

In 2019 not any progress.

In 2020 reading about python and data mining. Organizing my files. In 27th december 2020, created this github in order to have a clear definition about what I need to create and hope to make this useful and organized. In the same date also published a brief link about github location for testing purpose.
